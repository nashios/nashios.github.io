    <h1>NashiOS</h1>
    <b>A unix-like operating system built entirely from scratch</b>
    <p>The project started in May 2023
        with the goal of being a complete and functional operating system (maybe in 10 years?). The name comes from the
        fruit Pyrus pyrifolia which is a species of pear native to East Asia and is also called nashi pear.</p>
